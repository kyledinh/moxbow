The `index.html` in this directory was created by my elm-crosswords project. To rebuild it:

1. git clone git@github.com:billstclair/elm-crosswords.git
2. cd elm-crosswords
3. elm make Crosswords.elm --output index.html

The copy the resulting `index.html` into this directory.

I'm not set on this funny, bad-pun, logo. It was just an idea I got on the road one night. I may look for, or commission, a line drawing of a wooden crossbow.
