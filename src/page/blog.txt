What felt like shortly after the late Cretaceous Period, in the early years of the Internet, I was writing HTML by hand. Page after page, I would update links from one to another. I would make sure my copy was inside the appropriate tags and the XML syntax was correct.

I found Wordpress and lifted and carried a mysql dump with me to from one install to another.

A short stint with Wikis.

Github introduced me to love Markdown.

A fling with Gatsby.

Now enters Elm and Xossbow. Well, a modified Xossbow, I dubbed Moxbow.
